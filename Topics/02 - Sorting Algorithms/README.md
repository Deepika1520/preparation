## What is Sorting?

Sorting is an algorithm that arranges the elements of a list in a certain order [either ascending or descending]. The output is a permutation or reordering of the input.

Let's get started!

## Some Standard Sorting Algorithms

I started learning the sorting Algorithms by *memorizing their algorithms*, trying to remember how the code for all the commonly sorting algorithms is, and whenever asked, I used to just replicate it.

And this was a disaster, I was asked in an *interview a problem which required me to modify merge sort*, which I couldn't do because my basic knowlege about it was not clear.

I have went over a lot of websites and videos and I found a some really amazing videos which will change the way you learn and understand sorting. 

Here goes the list:

> The CS50 Sorting Videos are really great. Will help you understand the basics of how a sorting algorithm works (Have attached the link above!)
> As for the code part, **GeeksForGeeks** has provided a very detailed and simple approach to sorting!

## Resources

If you have time, do go ahead and read the **Chapter on Sorting** in the yellow book, it covers all the fundamentals required for interview prep!

Here is a list of materials which I referred and covered the important concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms - 

- <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/ZPfHmS5/data-structures-and-algorithms-narasimha-karumanchi.pdf" target="_blank">Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy: Data Structure and Algorithmic Puzzles, Second Edition</a> a.k.a **The Yellow Book**
- *This book is gold! I followed the timeline from this book and solved the examples given. It's amazing.*

- While solving the problems from the yellow book. Do checkout <a href="https://geeksforgeeks.org/" target="_blank">Geek For Geeks</a>
- Do not get swayed by the number and variety of problems in Geeks For Geeks and just focus on learning and implementing the optimal solution for the problem stated :P

- I would suggest if you have time,  start reading the **Bible of Algorithms** a.k.a <a href="https://ms.sapientia.ro/~kasa/Algorithms_3rd.pdf" target="_blank">C.L.R.S</a>
- This is a very complicated book. But. Once you start reading and understanding the algorithmic approach given here? You will love it. It keeps on getting better.

- Once you are all set with the concepts and **The Yellow Book**. Switch to **Leetcode** and **Hackerrank Interview Preparation Kit** and be prepared to be surprised by how easily you will be solving the problems in these websites.

>Solving a large number of questions will not take you anywhere, understanding and learning the concepts will help you in the long run!
