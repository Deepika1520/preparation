## What is A Linked List?

A linked list is a data structure used for storing collections of data. A linked list has the following properties.
- Successive elements are connected by pointers
- The last element points to NULL
- Can grow or shrink in size during execution of a program
- Can be made just as long as required (until systems memory exhausts).
- Does  not  waste  memory  space  (but  takes  some  extra  memory  for  pointers).  It allocates memory as list grows.

## Standard Problems in Linked Lists?

The idea is to understand the in-and-outs of linked lists so that we can solve (or get the idea) for every new problem we encounter. Here are some standard problems to get started!

## Resources

I was confused, very very confused about what should I refer to start my preparation. Thing was, I wanted to try and cover as many problems as I can. You never know what might happen tomorrow! What if the stacks question that you skipped while practice was asked to you in your Facebook Interview and you don't know how to solve it. Like every other student/programmer, I was greedy and wanted it all.

Here is a list of materials which I referred and covered the important concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms - 

- <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/ZPfHmS5/data-structures-and-algorithms-narasimha-karumanchi.pdf" target="_blank">Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy: Data Structure and Algorithmic Puzzles, Second Edition</a> a.k.a **The Yellow Book**
- *This book is gold! I followed the timeline from this book and solved the examples given. It's amazing.*

- While solving the problems from the yellow book. Do checkout <a href="https://geeksforgeeks.org/" target="_blank">Geek For Geeks</a>
- Do not get swayed by the number and variety of problems in Geeks For Geeks and just focus on learning and implementing the optimal solution for the problem stated :P

- I would suggest if you have time,  start reading the **Bible of Algorithms** a.k.a <a href="https://ms.sapientia.ro/~kasa/Algorithms_3rd.pdf" target="_blank">C.L.R.S</a>
- This is a very complicated book. But. Once you start reading and understanding the algorithmic approach given here? You will love it. It keeps on getting better.

- Once you are all set with the concepts and **The Yellow Book**. Switch to **Leetcode** and **Hackerrank Interview Preparation Kit** and be prepared to be surprised by how easily you will be solving the problems in these websites.

>Solving a large number of questions will not take you anywhere, understanding and learning the concepts will help you in the long run!
