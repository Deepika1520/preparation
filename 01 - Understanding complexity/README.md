## What is Time Complexity?

The time complexity of an algorithm is the total amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its execution. In simple words, every piece of code we write, takes time to execute. The time taken by any piece of code to run is known as the time complexity of that code. The lesser the time complexity, the faster the execution.

If you’ve programmed a bit before, you’re probably wondering how this can be of any use for you becuase your program was running fine even when you didn’t know all of this time complexity stuff, right? I agree with you 100% but there’s a catch. The time for a program to run does not depend solely on effentiency of code, it’s also dependent on the processing power of a PC. Since time complexity is used to measure the time for algorithms, the type of algorithms you’d use in a small program wouldn’t really matter because there’s hardly any work being carried out by the processor although when we write code in professional life, the code isn’t of 200 or 300 lines. It’s usually longer than a thesis written by a professor and in cases like that, a lot of processor power is being used. If your code is not effecient in terms of data structures, you might find yourself in a rather sticky situation.

## What is Space Complexity?

Space complexity measures the total amount of memory that an algorithm or operation needs to run according to its input size.
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/space-complexity">This</a> is an amazing article which covers the concepts behind space complexity.
Even <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-4-analysis-of-loops/?ref=lbp">Geeks for Geeks</a> has a very detailed approach towards how and why Space Complexity is important in piece of code.

## Resources

Here is a list of materials which I referred and covered the important concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms - 

- <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/ZPfHmS5/data-structures-and-algorithms-narasimha-karumanchi.pdf" target="_blank">Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy: Data Structure and Algorithmic Puzzles, Second Edition</a> a.k.a **The Yellow Book**
- *This book is gold! I followed the timeline from this book and solved the examples given. It's amazing.*

- While solving the problems from the yellow book. Do checkout <a href="https://geeksforgeeks.org/" target="_blank">Geek For Geeks</a>
- Do not get swayed by the number and variety of problems in Geeks For Geeks and just focus on learning and implementing the optimal solution for the problem stated :P

- I would suggest if you have time,  start reading the **Bible of Algorithms** a.k.a <a href="https://ms.sapientia.ro/~kasa/Algorithms_3rd.pdf" target="_blank">C.L.R.S</a>
- This is a very complicated book. But. Once you start reading and understanding the algorithmic approach given here? You will love it. It keeps on getting better.

- Once you are all set with the concepts and **The Yellow Book**. Switch to **Leetcode** and **Hackerrank Interview Preparation Kit** and be prepared to be surprised by how easily you will be solving the problems in these websites.

>Solving a large number of questions will not take you anywhere, understanding and learning the concepts will help you in the long run!
