The Ultimate Guide

Problems which took time for me - 

Reverse a Linked List<br>
Check whether tree is a BST (Start of with INT_MIN && INT_MAX)<br>
Spiral Level Order (two stacks)<br>
Bottom of the tree (Using hashtables and level order traversal)<br>
Root to Leaf total paths (Make a temporary path array)
